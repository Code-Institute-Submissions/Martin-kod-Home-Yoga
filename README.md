<h1>Home Sweet Yoga</h1>

Home Sweet Yoga is a website which offers Yoga classes to people in their own homes through online meetings. The main target group is casual practitioners and new beginners to yoga but does also offer intermediate and advanced courses. The website informs potential visitors to the site on how to become stronger, fitter and more flexible in a time-efficient way and how to sign up for the online yoga courses, which in turn of course is the business goal the website. 

<h2>Features</h2>

<strong>The navigation bar</strong> helps the user navigate the most important features of the website. The navigation bar also include suitable icons. Can be used to go back to the homepage from the sign-up-page.

<strong>The logo</strong> with an appropriate image encapturing home yoga. 

<strong>Information</strong> about the advantages of home yoga with an eye-capturing sign up-button.

<strong>Class levels</strong> are explained more thoroughly so visitors can make out which level is appropriate for them.

<strong>The schedule</strong> so that users are informed and can make choices accordingly.

<strong>The footer</strong> holds external links to social media platforms for further information or contact.

<strong>The sign-up-form</strong> is on its own html site and the users are required to fill in names, email and course level to be able to sign up for the site. 

<strong>Features for the future</strong> are some type of forum or news with comments to build up the website's sense of community. A photo gallery where the community can share pictures of themselves doing yoga would also be of interest to the website.

<h2>Testing</h2>

All of the HTML and CSS code have been tested in https://validator.w3.org/ https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator without errors and google dev tools Lighthouse feature with approved results. 

The website has resposive design technology incorporated but some elements do still overlap on screens with widths smaller than 500px.

A bug I struggled with squashing was to align the three divs in the class level section, but eventually I managed by rearranging the order in the index.html file. The git commits were also tricky in this, my first repository, for I often forgot to save before I used git commit and so I had to do it twice. 

<h2>Deployment</h2>

The website was deployed with GitHub pages. Deployment is done by clicking on settings in the repository and select pages in the menu. Then select main and save and refresh page until the link to the website is shown in the window. 

Here is live link to the website: https://martin-kod.github.io/Home-Yoga/

<h2>Credits</h2>

I used icons for the navigation menu as well as the corresponding sections on the site from https://fontawesome.com/ .

See you again soon,
